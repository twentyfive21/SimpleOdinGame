# SimpleOdinGame of Rock Paper Scissors

#Overview:
---
NOTE the javascript code at the end is not mines, but the one in the beginning is I needed some help tying my functions at the end. 
---
This game was a project from the odin project and also my first implementation of javascript. The goal was to get the computer and users selection. Then keep track of the score and print out the winner at the end. The task was to play this game from the console first to make sure the program was running smoothly. Then later down the line this game will have a graphical user interface with buttons. I had to create a number of functions and safe to say I learned alot, but I had to do alot of googling to help implement things. Not saying that anything is wrong with it just wanted to note my process. I also tried using the console to debug a little, but most of my errors were simple reference or syntax errors. 
### Things I learned 
*How to console.log for different functions to make sure I was getting the correct input*
*How to plan out my psuedocode before I starting coding *
*How to make strings go to lowercase and get prompt from the user*
*how to come up with my own functions and getting used to the syntax of Javascript*
*naming functions and making sure to use camelCase!*
*That I also need to improve my problem solving skills to be a better programmer and learn to simplify my code*

I figured out most of the functions except for the game() and checkWinner() functions which I had to watch a youtube video on how to figure the rest. Here is the link to the video if you need help, but I have the code also used in my javascript file: [https://youtu.be/shZuBowaYbk] . I used her code to simply my file and like to give credit where its due. If you look at my js file before I have my answers that I did my self so I had the right idea, but needed some things moved around. Her code in the video helped to simply my code. I found this project challenging since there were a few coding challenges in odin. They were no where near as helpful to figuring out this project for a first time beginner. The landing page(page using flexbox) before then was more successful since I had more practice examples that were geared toward the site. For this project however there were only basic operand functions and I wish the assignments were more geared toward this project. I feel like breaking down the function in assignments would of been less overwhelming as a project using javascript for the first time. I referenced the fundamentals many times and googled as much as I could before watching the video. I hope this helps someone I understand javascript so much more than I did before I just needed help at the last bit at the end since things weren't fitting as well as I wanted.

I will keep on coding and pushing myself to learn more!
